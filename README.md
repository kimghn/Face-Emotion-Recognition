# Face-Emotion-Recognition
A GUI that detects individuals’ facial emotions and gives a percentage for each emotion.

Using Python and the FER (Facial Emotion Recognition) library, I developed a GUI that takes an image as input, identifies the emotions displayed on the face, and provides a percentage-based analysis of each detected emotion.
For this project, you need to install the following libraries: fer, TensorFlow, Tkinter, PIL (Pillow), and NumPy.
This project is a strong example of computer vision and image processing.
